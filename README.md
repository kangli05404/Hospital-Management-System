# Hospital-Management-System
A comprehensive JavaFX-based Hospital Management System built as part of a university coursework project. The application allows for the management of Doctors, Patients, Staff, Medicines, Facilities, and Laboratories within a hospital setting.

This program is written entirely in Eclipse. Use this IDE, if possible, to ensure that the code run successfully.

Before running the project, you need to do these few steps:

1. Create a new Java Project.
2. Create a package under the Java Project and named it as "HospitalManagementSystem".
3. Add JavaFx library to your project (if it's not already added).
4. Import the downloaded source codes to your project.
